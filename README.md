# @Komdori 
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
- At work, I lead an R&D team developing next-gen power semiconductors for electric vehicles and renewable energy.
- I'm interested in power electronics, robotics, embedded controls, and programming at the intersection of physics and art.
- Currently learning javascript, 2D physics engines, plotting libraries, control systems, and GPU fragment and compute shaders.

## Collaboration
Iâ€™d love to collaborate on simulating some textbook mechanical control problems.
Examples:
- Gantry crane stabilization
- Balancing a ball on a tilting beam
- Swingup and stabilization of an inverted pendulum
- Getting input from a game controller to allow a user to try to control a hard-to-control thing

I'm still trying to determine best physics engine (matter.js, box2D, etc.) and plotting libraries.
I welcome any and all recommendations!

I think it would be cool to gamify of control system design as an education tool. As a student, I would have loved an interactive graphical simulation which intuitively explained practical complications:
  - Maximum actuator power / speed / displacement / cost
  - Integrator wind-up
  - Measurement uncertainty / estimators
  - Nonlinearities
  - Stability
